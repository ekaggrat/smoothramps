# smoothramps

This board is meant to be used with the standard ramps board as a replacement for the arduino mega. The purpose is to use smoothieware
on a ramps board as a alternative to the smoothieboard. This board lacks some of the bells and wistles of the smoothieboard like digipots 
but still has the basic functions to run a 3d printer.
